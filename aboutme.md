My name is Oscar Calzada. I was born and raised in Pico-Union, Los Angeles. 

At Williams College, I studied Chemistry and when I graduated I worked as a research assistant in pediatric leukemia at Boston Children's Hospital. Later, I honed my clinical research skills in adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at Emory University. 

Now, I aspire to integrate my previous basic & clinical science knowledge with the tools of data science to develop predictive models.
