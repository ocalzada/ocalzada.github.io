Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, 
we conducted sentiment analysis on Yelp User's text reviews to develop a web application that assigns an "adjusted" ratings score (1-5)
to free text. The training data we used to train our model was for all 100k reviews of tacos.
